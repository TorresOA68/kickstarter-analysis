 The purpose of the analysis is show how many people possible go, don't go to a theaater during the year. as well as how many people could'n go,and how many are going to cancel the visit to the theater.

The analysis was performed using the theater category because the this is based on this main category. The theater category was related with the number of people who possible go to theater during the years. To visualize the results a chart was created, because is a good way to see in this case how many peolple goes to theaterr during different months odf the year, how many don't go and how many cancel the theater visit.


As a concluion of the analysis, I foud:

- People goes more to theater on May, after that the situation change, at the end of the year less people go to theater, but anyway some people goes. May is the best month for the theater

- The cancelations are stables during all year long, the cancelation are low all year long.

- Percentage of peolple who goes to theater decrease when the range of people get bigger, 

- Percentange of people who don't go to theater increase when the range of people get bigger
