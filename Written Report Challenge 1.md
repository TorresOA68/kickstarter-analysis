PURPOSE
In this analysis I will show how many people goes to theater as well as people who don’t go, and people who cancelled the assistance.

Analysis
The analysis was performed using the theater (Main Category), relating this category with the number of people who possible goes to theater during the year; in this way we can see the tendency of the assistants every month, which is the best month when the people goes to theater, and which month is when less people goes to theater.







 
This graph shows that May is the best month for theater, is when more people goes to theater.
We can also, see the people tendency to assist to theater based on the range of people

 
Here we noticed that less than 1,000 people goes to theater. Based on the range of people.









Conclusions
More people go to theater on May, after this month the amount of people decrease, that means at the end of the year few people goes to theater. May is the best month for theater.
The cancelations are stable during the year, and they are low number of people who cancel the visit to theater.
Percentage of people who go to theater decrease when the rage of people increases.
Percentage of people who don’t go to theater increase when the range of people increase.

Limitation of the Dataset
I think that the dataset should have more columns like People Income, Distance to theaters, and Transportation facilities. With before information is possible to graph the access facility to theater.
